# Programming-102-Learning-Resource
I am going to create your own learning resource, that could be used to teach a novice about any one of the concepts youâ€™ve learned about in this course.
This is the assignment for the course to be peer-reviewed.

There are two folders called `documents` and `source`.

You will find the lesson plan and any other written information in documents and some code examples in the source folder. I encourage you to take the examples and chnage, add or modify to your convenience.

Documents are coded in markdown as it is this README file.
