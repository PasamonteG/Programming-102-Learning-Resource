# Lesson plan on python functions #

This lesson will cover the basics of function writing in Python.

|Class Level | Lesson |
|-------------|------|
|ICT Year 7/8/9  | Functions Basics |

## Lesson Summary ##
This lesson on Python functions could be adapted for any KS3 course making it more or less advanced depending on the level of the class.

Writing functions in any programming language is essential to develop an understanding of how software works.

This lesson will enable the students to search what parts of the code are candidate to be functions and how to use them in longer programs as bricks for complex coding.

**Time required:** 50 to 90 minutes to understand, explore and experiment.

## Objectives for this Lesson ##
_All students will_ learn to write simple functions as code bricks to perform specific tasks.

_Most students will_ be able to use several functions in the same program to get a full working set of tasks.

_Some students will_ be able to recognise what parts of a program are candidates to be recoded as a function.

## Activities ##
Timings are approximate and subject to the complexity of the examples used. They depend much on the level of the class.

The activities proposed are mixed for the teacher and the students.  

| Activity | Time Required |
|------|--------|
| **Starter.** Introduce functions as tasks. Explain the role of functions in programs.  | 5 - 10 mins |
| **Student discussion.** Let the students search some examples of real world activities that could be modelled as functions. |5 mins|
| **Teacher explanation.** Formal description of functions with working examples. Directly code them on screen or explain already coded examples. This explanation must be adjusted to the level of the class. |5 mins  
| **Student Task.** Build some programs with functions. You will need to provide a sheet or equivalent (projection or handwritten list on whiteboard...) with some exercises to be done (p.e. [Python functions - Exercises, Practice, Solution](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-functions-exercises.php).) This can be done individually or in couples.  | No time limit |

The teacher must manage the level of complexity in the last activity according to the course (Y7,Y8 or Y9). Both last activities can spread in more than one class, also depending on the depth of the subject.

## Review ##
**Student task.**  Ask some students to show their work (better if they can project) and make them run the programs they have coded. Keep some discussion on how the work has been done and the difficulties they have found.

## Materials Needed for the Class ##
Computers with Python installed, Python IDE to make testing easier, whiteboard or sheets for the students to be able to sketch their ideas.
