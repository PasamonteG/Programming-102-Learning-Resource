# Lesson plan on python functions #

This lesson will cover the basics of function writing in Python.

| Date  | Class | Lesson |

| 26 Aug 2019 | ICT Year 7/8/9  | Functions Basics |

## Context of the lesson ##
This lesson on Python functions could be adapted for any KS3 course making it more or less advanced depending on the level of the class.

Writing functions in any programming language is essential to develop an understanding of how software works.

This lesson will enable the students to search what parts of the code are candidate to be functions and how to use them in longer programs as bricks for complex coding.

**Time required:** 3 - 4 hours to understand, explore and experiment.

## Measurable Objectives for this Lesson ##
_All students will_ learn to write simple functions as code bricks to perform specific tasks.

_Most students will_ be able to use several functions in the same program to get a full working set of tasks.

_Some students will_ be able to recognise what parts of a program are candidates to be recoded as a function.

## Activities ##
Timings are approximate and subject to the complexity of the examples used. They depend much on the level of the class.

The activities proposed are mixed for the teacher and the students.  

| Activity | Time Required |
|------|--------|
| **Starter.** Introduce functions as tasks. Explain the role of functions in programs.  | 5 - 10 mins |
| **Student discussion.** Let the students search some examples of real world activities that could be modelled as functions. |5 mins|
| **Teacher explanation.** Formal description of functions with working examples. Directly code them on screen or explain already coded examples. This is an initial explanation, no need to use parameters and other subtleties at this moment. |5 mins  
| **Student Task.** Build some programs with functions. You will need to provide a sheet or equivalent (projection or handwritten list on whiteboard...) with some exercises to be done (p.e. [Python functions - Exercises, Practice, Solution](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-functions-exercises.php).) This can be done individually or in couples.  | No time limit |

The teacher must manage the level of complexity in the last activity
