## Context of the lesson ##
This lesson on Python functions could be adapted for any KS3 course making it more or less advanced depending on the level of the class.

Writing functions in any programming language is essential to develop an understanding of how software works.

This lesson will enable the students to search what parts of the code are candidate to be functions and how to use them in longer programs as bricks for complex coding.

**Time required:** 3 - 4 hours to understand, explore and experiment.

## Measurable Objectives for this Lesson ##
_All students will_ learn to write simple functions as code bricks to perform specific tasks.

_Most students will_ be able to use several functions in the same program to get a full working set of tasks.

_Some students will_ be able to recognise what parts of a program are candidates to be recoded as a function.
